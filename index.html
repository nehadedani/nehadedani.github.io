<h2>  <left> About Me </left></h2>
    <div class=".textBox">
<p> I was born and raised in India, and moved to US just before the start of my
            junior year of high school with the rest of my family. I finished my
            high school in Georgia and then got into KSU to study biochemistry in 2018.
            I am about to graduate in fall of this year with a degree in Software
            Engineering. Over the course of 4 years, I’ve changed my major several
            times until I found a passion for programming.
            Deeper into my pursuit of the Software Engineering degree, I’ve grown to
            like UI/UX projects, and am planning on pursuing that after graduation.
            Academics aside, I love playing badminton, reading a good fiction book
            and watching movies on my phone. My friends are currently teaching me
            racquetball, and I’m enjoying every second of it. Oh, and I absolutely love
            coffee. Thank you for making it all the way through till the end! </p>
